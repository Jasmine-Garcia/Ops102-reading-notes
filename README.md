The topic below matters because chips the size of ants were used by China to gain secured intelligence. This is a wake up call as it is something that can happen again.

**<h3> 1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack? </h3>**
Hardware hacks are physical and are more difficult to fix because it often means there needs to be a replacement for the hardware. This can also mean that the hardware can continue to be mainuplated until there is a replacement. While a software hack can be fixed with an update. 

**<h3> 2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?</h3>**
One way consists of manipulating devices as they’re in transit from the manufacturer to the customer. The second way involves seeding changes from the very beginning.

**<h3> 3. Explain how the hack worked.</h3>**

1. A Chinese military unit created microchips as tiny as a sharpened pencil tip. Some of the chips were built to look like signal condition couplers, and they incorporated memory, networking capability, and sufficient procession power for an attack.

2. The microchips were inserted at Chinese factories that supplied Supermicro, one of the world’s biggest sellers of server motherboards. 

3. The compromised motherboards were built into servers assembled by Supermicro.

4. The sabotaged servers made their way inside data centers operated by dozens of companies.

5. When a server was installed and switched on, the microchip altered the operating system’s core so it could accept modifications. The chip could also contact computers controlled by the attackers in search of further instructions and code. 

**<h3> 4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source? </h3>**

Investigators were able to track each piece of hardware. Components leave a shipping and invoices information. Boards have serial numbers that trace to specific factories. To track the corrupted chips to their source, U.S. intelligence agencies began following Supermicro’s serpentine supply chain in reverse.

**<h3> The 4 Things Common to All Computers </h3>**
1. Input

    - The things we do to tell a computer to do "stuff".
    - "Stuff" examples: utilzing our keyboar, mouse, microphone, camera, touch screen, etc. 
2. Storage

    - The inputs ("stuff") give a computer information, which is then stored in memory. 
    
3. Processing

    - A computer's processor takes information from the memory and manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm. Which is a series of commands.
    -   Then it sends the processed information back to be stored in the memory again.
    - This continiues until te processed inofmation is ready to be output. 
4. Output

    - The way a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do. For example: Text, photos, videos, or games 


*Additional Notes*

- The earliest computer were made of wood and metal with mechanical levers and gears.
    
- By the 20th century, computers started using electrical components.
